4.	The frontend dynamically displays the fetched products.
Workflow 2: Adding Products to Cart
1.	User selects a product and adds it to their cart.
2.	The frontend temporarily stores the cart details locally or in session storage.
Workflow 3: Placing an Order
1.	User proceeds to checkout and submits the order.
2.	Frontend sends customer and order details to the /orders API endpoint.
3.	Sanity CMS stores the order details.
4.	Payment Gateway processes the transaction.
5.	Confirmation message is sent to the user.
Workflow 4: Shipment Tracking

Product Schema:
export default {
  name: 'product',
  type: 'document',
  fields: [

    { name: 'price', type: 'number', title: 'Price' },
    { name: 'stock', type: 'number', title: 'Stock Level' },

export default {
  name: 'order',
  type: 'document',
  fields: [
    { name: 'customerId', type: 'string', title: 'Customer ID' },
    { name: 'products', type: 'array', of: [{ type: 'object', fields: [
      { name: 'productId', type: 'string', title: 'Product ID' },
      { name: 'quantity', type: 'number', title: 'Quantity' }
