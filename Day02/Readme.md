**Day 2 - Planning the Technical Foundation**

On Day 2, the focus was on transitioning from business goals to a solid technical foundation for the marketplace project. The activities were structured to ensure a comprehensive and professional approach to system design, data workflows, and API specifications.

### Key Highlights:
1. **Defining Technical Requirements**:
   - Identified the frontend requirements, including a responsive user interface for product browsing, cart management, and checkout workflows.
   - Emphasized the use of Sanity CMS for managing product data, customer details, and order records.
   - Integrated third-party APIs for shipment tracking and payment processing.

2. **System Architecture Design**:
   - Developed a high-level architecture diagram to visualize interactions between the frontend, Sanity CMS, and third-party APIs.
   - Illustrated data flows, showcasing how product data is fetched, orders are placed, and shipment tracking is handled.

3. **API Requirements Planning**:
   - Outlined key API endpoints with details such as methods, payloads, and responses.
   - Examples included:
     - `/products`: Fetches product data.
     - `/orders`: Submits a new order with customer and payment information.
     - `/shipment`: Tracks shipment status via a third-party API.

4. **Sanity Schema Design**:
   - Designed schemas in Sanity CMS to handle key data entities, such as products, orders, and customers.
   - Example fields for a product schema included `name`, `price`, and `stock`.

5. **Technical Documentation**:
   - Created structured documentation covering system architecture, workflows, API requirements, and schema designs.
   - Visual workflows detailed steps such as adding products to the cart and placing an order.

6. **Collaboration and Refinement**:
   - Engaged in peer reviews and brainstorming sessions to refine technical plans.
   - Incorporated feedback to improve scalability, performance, and user experience.

### Outcome:
By the end of Day 2, students had:
- A clear system architecture with diagrams and workflows tailored to their marketplace type.
- Well-defined API endpoints and data schemas.
- Professional documentation that can be used for portfolio submissions or project presentations.

This foundational work ensured that the team was well-prepared for implementation on Day 3, focusing on building a fully functional and efficient marketplace.
